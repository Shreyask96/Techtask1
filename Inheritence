==> what if my child class has lesser access modifier
	   // private void walk()

If you attempt to declare a method in a child class with a more restrictive access modifier than that of the method in the parent class, 
it will result in a compilation error.
To resolve this issue, you should keep the access modifier of the method in the child class the same as, or less restrictive than, 
the access modifier of the method in the parent class.
